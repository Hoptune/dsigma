Background
##########

Here, we will give a brief overview over the various equations and estimators
provided by :code:`dsigma`. However, this document is not a full theoretical
discussion of the theory of gravitational lensing and galaxy-galaxy lensing
in particular. For this, we refer the reader to suitable standard literature
like `Bartelmann (2001)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PhR...340..291B/abstract>`_.


**********************
Excess Surface Density
**********************

The ultimatel goal of :code:`dsigma` is to provide estimates of the mean
so-called excess surface density (ESD), also written as :math:`\Delta\Sigma`,
around a set of "lens" galaxies. The ESD defined as the following quantity:

.. math::
    
    \Delta\Sigma (r_p) = \langle \Sigma (<r_p) \rangle - \Sigma (r_p), .

The first term is the (area-weigthed) average surface density inside a circle
of (projected) radius :math:`r_p` around the lens galaxy and the second term
the mean surface density at the edge of that circle.

For most applications, the ESD will be positive since the surface density
generally decreases with increasing distance :math:`r_p` from the lens. It is
worthwhile to look at a few limiting cases. For example, for a point mass, the
first term in the above equation can be shown to be :math:`M / \pi r_p^2`
whereas the second term vanishes. Thus, :math:`\Delta\Sigma = M / \pi r_p^2`.
For non-trivial mass distributions, the above expression is more complicated.
However, if we have two mass distributions whose only difference is a
re-scaling, i.e. :math:`\Sigma_1 (r_p) / \Sigma_2 (r_p) = c` or
:math:`\rho (r) / \rho_2 (r) = c` (:math:`\rho` refers to the three-dimensional
density), then the two ESDs obey :math:`\Delta\Sigma_1 / \Delta\Sigma_2 = c`.
Ultimetaly, :math:`\Delta\Sigma` is a measure of the distribution of mass (both
baryonic and dark) around lens galaxies.


****************
Tangential Shear
****************

In the framework of general relativity, mass and energy affects the space-time
metric which ultimately leads to the deflection of light by the gravitational
field of an object. On cosmological distances, the potential light deflection
is a function of the so-called critical surface density,
:math:`\Sigma_\mathrm{crit}`.

.. math::

    \Sigma_\mathrm{crit} (z_l, z_s) = \frac{c^2}{4\pi G} \frac{D_A (z_s)}{
        D_A (z_l) D_A (z_l, z_s)} \, .

In the above equation, :math:`D_A` denotes the angular diameter distance as a
function of redshift :math:`z`. Particularly, :math:`z_s` denotes the redshift
of the "source" from which the light was emitted. Obviously, the source must
be placed behind the lens, i.e. :math:`z_l < z_s` for light deflection to
occur.

In the weak lensing regime, the surface densities of the lenses are small
compared to the critical surface density, i.e. :math:`\Delta\Sigma \lll
\Sigma_\mathrm{crit}`. In this regime, gravitational lensing will cause small,
subtle changes in the apparent shapes of background "source" objects, e.g.
source galaxies. Particularly, the shapes of background source galaxies
will be prefentially aligned perpendicular (if :math:`\Delta\Sigma > 0`) with
respect to the foreground lens galaxies. This can be expressed in terms of the
mean tangential shear :math:`\gamma_t`. In the weak lensing regime, the
relationship between the different quantities is particularly simple:

.. math::

    \gamma_t = \frac{\Delta \Sigma}{\Sigma_\mathrm{crit}} \, .

Thus, by measuring the shapes of source galaxies (in addition to the redshifts
of lens and source galaxies), we can get an estimate of :math:`\Delta\Sigma`.


***************
Naive Estimator
***************

Unfortunately, galaxies are not perfectly round objects and instead are often
intrinsically elliptical with random orientations. Thus, the shape of an
individual source galaxy with respect to a lens galaxy will be dominated by its
intrinsic random shape and orientation instead of the gravitational lensing
signal we are after. This effect is also known as "shape noise". In order to
get to the gravitational tangential shear signal, we need to average the
tangential ellipticities :math:`e_t` of a large number of lens-source pairs to
overcome the shape noise. On average, it is true that :math:`\langle e_t
\rangle = \gamma_t`. A naive, minimum variance estimator for :math:`\Delta
\Sigma` is

.. math::

    \Delta\Sigma =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{ls} \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}} (z_l, z_s) e_t}{
            \sum_{ls} w_{ls}} \, .

where

.. math::

    w_{ls} = \frac{w_s}{\Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}^2 (z_l, z_s)}

and :math:`w_s` is a source weight designed to minimize errors due to noise
in the shape meeasurements themselves. :math:`\sum_{ls}` denotes that the
summation goes over all suitable lens-source pairs separated by a certain
projected distance. Evaluation the above equation is one of the main tasks
of :code:`dsigma`.

Although the above equation looks simple enough, for many applications the
number of suitable lens-source pairs can easily be in the range of billions.
Furthermore, the total number of lens-source combinations (irrespective of
whether they are separated by the correct distance) can easily reach trillions.
If one is not careful, simple python implementations of the above sum can
be computationally prohibitve. :code:`dsigma` has various smart ways of
calculating the sum in an efficient manner.


****************
Correction Terms
****************

Another reason for using :code:`dsigma` is that the above estimator will be
biased in almost all practical applications. One must additionally apply a
variety of corrections to get an unbiased estimate of :math:`\Delta\Sigma`. In
the following, we will describe and motivate the various corrections
implemented in the code.

Biased Lens Sample
==================

Oftentimes, our lens sample is not complete. For example, for spectroscopic
surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or the Dark Energy spectroscopic
Instrument Survey, we might only have redshifs for a subset of all lens
galaxies. Since redshifts are required to estimate :math:`\Delta\Sigma`,
lens galaxies without redshifts have to be excluded from the analysis. However,
depending in the properties of the lens incompleteness, the intrinsic
:math:`\Delta\Sigma` is often correlated with whether a lens galaxy makes it
into our sample. Thus, the naive :math:`\Delta\Sigma` estimate using the
incomplete lens sample could be biased with respect to the :math:`\Delta\Sigma`
of the complete sample. This effect can be counteracted by assigning suitable
systematic weights :math:`w_{\mathrm{sys}, l}` to the lens galaxies that are
used for the stacking. In this case, we simply replace the above estimator with

.. math::
    
    \Delta\Sigma =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls} \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}
              (z_l, z_s) e_t}{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls}} \, .


Photometric Redshifts
=====================

When calculating the critical surface density :math:`\Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}`,
we need to know both lens and source redshift. However, in many lensing
surveys, we only have very inaccurate and possibly biased photometric redshifts
for sources. Even in case of just inaccurate redshifts, this can cause
systematic biases in the calculation of :math:`\Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}`.
However, if we have a "calibration" catalog of source with their inaccurate
photometric redshifts and their true redshifts, we can statistically
correct for the bias. The correction factor is called :math:`f_\mathrm{bias}`
and can be calculated via

.. math::

    f_{\rm bias}^{-1} (z_l) =
        \frac{\sum_s w_{\mathrm{sys}, s} w_s \Sigma_\mathrm{crit, true}^{-1}
              \Sigma_\mathrm{crit, photo-z}^{-1}}{\sum_s w_{\mathrm{sys}, s}
              w_s \Sigma_{ls, \mathrm{photo-z}}^{-2}} =
        \langle \Sigma_\mathrm{crit, photo-z} / \Sigma_\mathrm{crit, true}
        \rangle\, ,

where :math:`w_{\mathrm{sys}, s}` is an additional weight assigned to each
source in the calibration catalog to counter-act biases (similar to biases in
the lens sample) or to account for different response to shear (see below).

To apply this correction, the estimator becomes

.. math::

    \Delta\Sigma =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls} \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}
              (z_l, z_s) e_t f_\mathrm{bias} (z_l)}{\sum_{ls}
              w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls}} \, .

The above formalism can also be extended to the limiting the case that we have
no reliable redshift estimate for any individual source galaxy and instead only
know an (effective) true redshift distribution :math:`n(z)` for the entire
population. In this case, the above estimator becomes

.. math::

    \Delta\Sigma =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_s \langle
              \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}^{-1} (z_l) \rangle e_t}{\sum_{ls}
              w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_s \langle \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}^{-1} (z_l)
              \rangle^2} \, .

where

.. math::

    \langle \Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}^{-1} (z_l) \rangle = \int \Sigma_{\rm crit}
        (z_l, z_s) n(z_s) \mathrm{d}z_s


Boost Factor
============

The photometric redshift correction above only accounts for the average effect
of photometric redshift errors. However, it doesn't take into account that
close to real lenses there is an over-abundance of physically associated
sources. As a result, close to real lenses, a larger fraction of sources have 
rue redshifts placing them close to the lens, i.e. :math:`z_{\rm l} \approx
z_{\rm s}` than what was going into the calculation of :math:`f_{\rm bias}`.
For those physically associated sources :math:`\Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx
\infty`, i.e. they do not induce any shear. Not taking this effect into account
can lead to an underestimate of the true lensing amplitue. One way to correct
for this effect is to calculate the so-called boost factor :math:`b` via

.. math::

    b =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls}}{\sum_{rs}
              w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls}} \, .

Note that the sum in the denominator goes over a set of random lenses with the
same overall redshift and spatial extent as the true lenses. Effectively, we
are trying to detect any over-abundance of sources close to lenses as opposed
to random points. If sources cluster around lenses, i.e. there is an
over-abundance of sources physically associated with the lenses, then :math:`b
\geq 1`. To apply the correction, we multiply the raw lensing signal by the
radially dependent boost factor :math:`b`.

Note however, that this boost factor estimate might be biased for various shape
detection algorithms. For example, it is not unreasonable to assume that a
larger fraction of potential source galaxies are rejected close to massive
cluster lenses due to an increase in blending between different sources. This
woud lead to biases in the estimate of :math:`b`.


Shear Response
==============

Although the algorithms used by different weak lensing groups are very
sophisticated, the measured shapes of galaxies can still be biased. We need to
correct for this in the galaxy-galaxy lensing estimator in order to get
unbiased estimates of :math:`\Delta\Sigma`. Typically, lensing surveys provide
a (scalar) bias estimate :math:`m` for every object or group of objects. This
bias quantifies the response of the measured shapes to changes in intrinsic
shapes such that, on average, the measured ellipticities are biased by
:math:`1 + m`. In order to correct for this bias, one first calculates the
average shear bias via

.. math::

    \bar{m} =
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys, l}} w_{ls} m_s}{\sum_{ls}
              w_{\mathrm{sys, l}} w_{ls}} \, .

To apply the correction, we simply divide the raw lensing signal by :math:`1 +
\bar{m}` in each radial bin. For some applications, it is important that this
correction is applied to a set of lens-source pairs and not every object
individually. The reason is that individual shear bias estimates might be
noisy. Thus, applying this correction to the shapes of individual objects can
lead to biases because generally :math:`\langle 1 + m \rangle^{-1} \neq
\langle (1 + m)^{-1} \rangle`.

The Dark Energy Survey uses the shear measurement code METACALIBRATION. This
code generalizes the shear response formalism by providing a shear response
tensor :math:`\mathbf{R}` instead of a scalar.

.. math::

    \mathbf{R} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}}{\partial \mathbf{\gamma}} =
                 \begin{bmatrix} R_{11} & R_{12}\\R_{21} & R_{22} \end{bmatrix}

This formalism allows it to quantify, for example, how the sensitivity to shape
distortions depends on direction. However, this does not change the response
formalism substantially. Instead of averaging the (scalar) bias, we average
the projection of the response tensor onto the tangential direction of the
lens-source pair,

.. math::

    R_t = R_{11} \cos^2 (2 \phi) + R_{22} \sin^2 (2 \phi)+ (R_{12} + R_{21})
          \sin (2 \phi) \cos (2 \phi)

where :math:`\phi` is the polar angle of the source in the lens coordinate
system. We then just calculate the mean tangential shear response and divide
:math:`\Delta\Sigma` by :math:`\overline{R_t}`, similar to the scalar case.

Shear Responsivity
==================

Depending on the shape estimator, the ellipticity vector of some shape
detection algorithm will be biased :math:`2 (1 - e_\mathrm{rms}^2)`, where
:math:`e_\mathrm{rms}` is the intrinsic shape dispersion per component. In
contrast to the shear response bias, this bias is not due to, for example
imperfections like blending, and instead is a natural mathematical property of
the estimator. Nonetheless, we need to correct for it and we do so in virtually
the same way as for the shear response bias.

.. math::

    \mathcal{R} = 1 -
        \frac{\sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls} e_{{\rm rms}, s}^2}{
              \sum_{ls} w_{\mathrm{sys}, l} w_{ls}} \, .

To apply the shear responsivity correction, we need to divide the final lensing
signal by :math:`2\mathcal{R}`. This correction is somewhat large so it is
critical to apply it when necessary. One example is the public shape catalog
of the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey.

Selection Bias
==============

While the shear response and responsivity describe how the measured shapes of
individual galaxies are affected by the measurement pipeline, the selection
bias describes the phenomenon that the selection of sources, i.e. quality
cuts, can depend on the intrinsic shape itself. Without correcting for this
effect, this could lead to biases in the mean tangential shear.

Correcting for selection bias is handled very differently between different
surveys. Details about the selection bias in the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey can
be found in section 5.6.2 of `Mandelbaum et al. (2018)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.3170M/abstract>`_. Similarly,
details on the selection bias in the Dark Energy Survey can be found in
`Sheldon & Huff (2017)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...841...24S>`_. We also refer the
reader to their respective tutorials where these correction factors are
implemented. Luckily, the selection bias affects the shear only at the level
of :math:`\sim 1\%`.

Random Subtraction
==================

Often, we can calculate the lensing signal around a set of random lenses with
the same overall redshift and spatial distribution as the true lenses. If these
random lenses are truly random, they have no correlation with the large-scale
matter field. As a result, they should give a lensing amplitude consistent with
0. However, lensing systematics like systematic shears can lead to non-zero
signals even for random points. Subtracting those points can alleviate such
systematic errors. Furthermore, even in the absence of lensing systematics,
subtracting randoms leads to a reduced variance of the lensing signal on large
scales, as shown in `Singh et al. (2017)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.3827S/abstract>`_.
