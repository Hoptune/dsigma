Installation
############

Currently, the recommended version of :code:`dsigma` is the most recent version
from the :code:`main` branch from the GitHub repository. The following install
command via :code:`pip` should install the code and all its dependencies.

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/johannesulf/dsigma.git@main

The package is written in pure python so installion should be quick without
the need to compile any code. The following packages are required for running
:code:`dsigma`.

* :code:`numpy`
* :code:`scipy`
* :code:`astropy`
* :code:`scikit-learn`
* :code:`healpy`

Additionally, for calculating the lens magnification bias, installation of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) code :code:`camb` is recommended.
However,  this is no hard requirement and :code:`dsigma` will run fine without
it.
