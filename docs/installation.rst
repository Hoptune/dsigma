Installation
============

Currently, there is no stable version of ``dsigma``. Thus, you need to install
the package directly from github. Fortunately, doing so is rather
straightforward. The following command should suffice. ::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/johannesulf/dsigma.git@dsigma_dev
