# A Simple Python Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing Pipeline

`dsigma` is an easy-to-use pipeline for analyzing galaxy-galaxy lensing. It is
written in pure python, has a broadly applicable API and is optimized for
computational efficiency. While originally intended to be used with the shape
catalog of the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, it should work for other
surveys like the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) or
the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS).
